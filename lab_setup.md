Prerequisites

-A virtualized environment to ensure safety.

-Microsoft Office (with macro support enabled for testing).

-Windows 10/11 Virtual Machine.

-A monitoring tool like Procmon or Wireshark to analyze execution.

-Defender or an AV solution for testing detection and evasion techniques.


Lab Setup

1. Create a Virtualized Testing Environment

-Use VMware or VirtualBox to set up an isolated Windows VM.

-Ensure the VM is not connected to a production network.

2. Disable Defender (Optional for Testing)

-Open Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Turn off real-time protection.

-This step is optional and should be done with caution.

3. Enable Macros in Microsoft Office

-Open Word/Excel → Options → Trust Center → Macro Settings.

-Set to Enable all macros (for testing purposes only).

4. Load the Macro into a Document

-Open Microsoft Word/Excel.

-Press ALT + F11 to open the VBA Editor.

-Insert the sanitized harmless_macro.bas file into a new module.

5. Monitor Execution

-Use Wireshark to check for outbound connections.

-Use Procmon to monitor process execution.

-Check Windows Event Logs for suspicious activity.

6. Analyze Defender/AV Detection

-Re-enable Defender and observe if the macro execution gets blocked.

-Test different payload obfuscation techniques (without actual malware).



Safety Precautions

-Never test on a real network.

-Use snapshots in your VM to revert changes.

-Do not upload actual payloads to GitHub or share them publicly.

-By following this guide, you can safely explore macro-based attacks in a controlled and ethical manner.
