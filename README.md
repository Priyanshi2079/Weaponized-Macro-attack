# MacrosExploitation_ReverseShell
This project explores macro exploitation in penetration testing, demonstrating how malicious VBA macros can execute arbitrary code on a target system. By leveraging PowerShell commands, the attack can establish a reverse shell connection, highlighting the risks associated with macro-based threats. Designed strictly for educational and ethical hacking research.

## Included Files
- [**lab_setup.md**](lab_setup.md) - Guide to setting up the environment for testing the macro-based attack.
- [**Research_notes.md**](Research_notes.md) - Explanation of how the macro executes the payload and the technical details behind it.

- [**encodePayload.md**](encodePlayload.md) - Discusses Base64 encoding, AMSI, and bypassing real-time protection.
# Reverse Shell via Malicious VBA Macros

## Features
- **Automated Execution:** The script triggers upon document open.
- **PowerShell Payload Execution:** The macro runs a PowerShell command to establish a reverse shell connection.
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** Optionally, Base64 encoding can be used to bypass basic security filters.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.bas` file in a VBA editor within Microsoft Office.
3. Modify the **ATTACKER_IP** and **PORT** values to match your listener setup.
4. Save and execute the macro-enabled document.
5. Start a Netcat listener on your attack machine:
   ```bash
   nc -lvnp <PORT>
   ```
6. Wait for the reverse shell connection.

## Security Considerations
- This project is intended for **educational and research purposes only**.
- Unauthorized use of this technique is illegal and unethical.
- Always test in an isolated environment with explicit permission.

## Bonus: Base64 Encoding (Optional)
For evading basic detection mechanisms, the PowerShell payload can be encoded in Base64. However, this step is not required for the projectâ€™s functionality. The encoded payload can help bypass certain security filters but should be used strictly for research purposes.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of these techniques is illegal and unethical. Always use these methods in a controlled environment and with proper authorization.
